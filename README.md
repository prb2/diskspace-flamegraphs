# diskspace-flamegraphs

Simple script that can create flamegraphs showing disk usage by directory, using [Brendan Gregg's FlameGraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph).

## Usage

To profile disk usage for the directory `~/foo` and all of its children:
```
$ python main.py ~/foo > foo.log
```

Then run the [FlameGraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph) tool on the generated output:
```
$ flamegraph.pl foo.log > foo.svg
```

As an example, here's the output generated by profiling my Steam folder:
